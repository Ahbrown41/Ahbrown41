# Welcome to my Repositories.

My name is Alex and I have been developing and managing development teams for over 20 years.  
From a development perspective, I am always tinkering, learning and building my knowledge about software and infrastructure that it runs on.

I am a Pologlot developer with a specialty on Java, Golang and Ruby with a smattering of Python, Lua and other languages.

I have a few public repositories and will be adding more soon!
